## About the Project

For the final project of [INFO 247](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/247) of Spring 2023, we decided to investigate and research water use in the fashion industry. This website aims to capture a small piece of that discussion through an informative scrollytelly-like website with visualizations and analogies.

## Motivation

The fashion business is undeniably glamorous, but few are aware of its shadowy side. The clothing industry generates 20% of the world's wastewater and two billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the fabric dyeing process, which primarily utilizes synthetic dyes, is the largest water polluter, only second to global nutrient pollution.

## Project Goals

The goals for this data visualization project focusing on the environmental impact of the fashion industry are as follows:

1. Raise awareness: Increase public understanding of the environmental issues associated with the fashion industry, such as water pollution, carbon emissions, and resource consumption.

2. Inform decision-making: Provide clear and concise information to guide consumers, industry professionals, and policymakers towards more sustainable choices in production, consumption, and policy development.

3. Identify trends and patterns: Reveal significant patterns and trends in the data, highlighting areas where improvements can be made to reduce the industry's environmental impact.

4. Encourage sustainable practices: Promote eco-friendly alternatives in material selection, production processes, and consumer behavior, leading to a greener fashion industry.

By achieving these goals, the data visualization project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the environmental challenges faced by the fashion industry and inspire more sustainable practices, ultimately reducing the industry's negative effects on the environment.

## Data

In our visualization, various data sets were analyzed and integrated to provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental impact of the textile and fashion industry. These data sets were collected from research papers and reports published by international organizations, ensuring their relevance and usefulness to the project. Prior to using each data set, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted in Excel to clean the data and ensure its relevance.

Fiber Bible part 2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331980907_Environmental_impact_of_textile_fibres_-_what_we_know_and_what_we_don't_know_Fiber_Bible_part_2). This report, published by Mistra Future Fashion, provides an overview of the environmental impact of various textile fibers. It examines the sustainability of fibers from natural, regenerated, and synthetic sources. The report includes information on the life cycle assessments (LCAs) of different fibers, their water and energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and chemical use. It also highlights knowledge gaps and research needs related to the environmental impact of textile fibers.

2. [Environmental assessment of Swedish clothing consumption – six garments, sustainable futures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335653501_Environmental_assessment_of_Swedish_clothing_consumption_-_six_garments_sustainable_futures). This report, published by Mistra Future Fashion, evaluates the environmental impact of six different garments typically consumed in Sweden. The report analyzes the life cycle of these garments, including production, use, and end-of-life stages. The study provides data on the environmental performance of the selected garments, with a focus on climate change, resource depletion, and water scarcity. It also discusses potential future scenarios and provides recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of clothing consumption.

3. [Pulse of the Fashion Industry - Global Fashion Agenda & BCG](https://globalfashionagenda.org/product/pulse-of-the-fashion-industry-2017/). This report, published by the Global Fashion Agenda and The Boston Consulting Group (BCG), offers a comprehensive analysis of the fashion industry's environmental and social performance. The report provides data on various aspects of the industry, such as water use, chemical use, carbon emissions, and labor conditions. It also presents a "Pulse Score," which measures the sustainability performance of different segments within the industry. Additionally, the report identifies opportunities for improvement and proposes various initiatives to help the industry become more sustainable.
